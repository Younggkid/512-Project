First, start node server:

`python3 node.py`

It should have two nodes running on different port based on Flask framework.

then create a local wallet and generate private key:

`python3 run_wallet.py -p [port]` 

and start mining at some ports.

`python3 run_miner.py -p [port]`

Note the port should be the same for the same node, miner, and wallet.
